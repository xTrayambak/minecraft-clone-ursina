# A Minecraft-type survival game.

A Minecraft type of game in Python and OpenGL, yes.

_______________
**RUNNING THE GAME**
In the future, a launcher will be released, for now, you need to have Python 3.x installed, then go to cmd and type:
```
pip install pyglet
```
This'll install Pyglet, a multimedia library and a wrapper around OpenGL.
Then, run the game. It should work.
